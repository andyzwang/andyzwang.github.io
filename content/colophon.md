Two design decisions guided this website's design: 
1. File over app.
2. Open source rocks.

As a result, this site was written and edited in [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) using (R)Markdown files. My text files are compiled into web pages using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

I wanted my website to emulate a comfortable analog reading experience: I made use of the wonderful [Hugo Apero](https://github.com/hugo-apero/) template, customized it with Steph Ango's [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki) color palate, and edited with some TLC by me. My header font is [Inter Display Bold](https://rsms.me/inter/), and my body text is [Cardo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cardo).

Thank you to [Daiki Yoshioka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daiki-yoshioka/) for the wonderful headshot.
